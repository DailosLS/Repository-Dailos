    <p>The Last of Us is a video game about an apocalyptic world in which a fungus called Cordyceps has appeared, which brings out the most aggressive instincts in humans, making them look like zombies and not conscious of their actions, with no cure.</p>
    <p>In the first game this saga has two installments you control a man named Joel, who, due to the apocalypse, lost his daughter and had to resort to smuggling various substances and weapons. One day, however, one of his few friends, Tess, tells him that this time she's going to smuggle a 14-year-old girl named Ellie. After a series of events, they realize that Ellie is no ordinary girl, she's immune to Cordyceps because she was bitten by an infected person some time ago, but showed no signs of the fungus affecting her.</p>
